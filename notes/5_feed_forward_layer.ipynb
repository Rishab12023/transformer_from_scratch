    "### Feed-Forward Layer in Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Transformer architecture, the multi-head self-attention mechanism and other components preceding it (like linear projections and residual connections) are composed entirely of **linear operations**. While these are powerful for learning weighted combinations of inputs, **they are inherently limited in capturing non-linear relationships** within the data. If we were to stack only these linear operations across multiple layers, the entire model would effectively behave as a single linear transformation ‚Äî regardless of depth ‚Äî and thus would fail to model complex patterns required for understanding natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this limitation, **each position-wise output from the self-attention mechanism is passed through a Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFN)**, introducing essential **non-linearity** into the architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "This FFN is **applied identically and independently to each token (i.e., position-wise)** in the sequence. It consists of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation (typically **ReLU**) in between:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{FFN}(x) = \\text{ReLU}(xW_1 + b_1)W_2 + b_2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "-  x is the input (a contextualized embedding of size 512),\n",
    "-  $$W_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{512 \\times 2048}$$ \n",
    "-  $$W_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2048 \\times 512}$$ \n",
    "-  $$b_1 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{2048}$$ \n",
    "-  $$b_2 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{512}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure effectively creates a **two-layer MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)** with a **ReLU activation** between the layers. The dimensionality is first expanded (from 512 to 2048) to allow the model to project the input into a higher-dimensional space where complex patterns can be more easily separated and learned. It is then projected back to 512 dimensions to maintain consistency with the rest of the model's architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of the **Universal Approximation Theorem**, this FFN allows the model to approximate a wide variety of non-linear functions, thereby significantly enhancing the representational capacity of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "- The FFN introduces **non-linearity**, which is critical for learning complex patterns.\n",
    "- It is applied **independently to each token**.\n",
    "- It uses a **hidden layer of size 2048** with a ReLU activation to increase the model‚Äôs expressiveness.\n",
    "- It ensures that even if attention layers remain linear, the overall Transformer block remains a **non-linear function** of the input.\n",

    "## Understanding the Feed-Forward Layer as a 1√ó1 Convolution in Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Transformer architecture, the **position-wise feed-forward network (FFN)** operates on each token independently, after self-attention has provided contextualized embeddings. Interestingly, this FFN can be interpreted as **two 1√ó1 convolutions** applied across the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ‚úÖ Core Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "> When we consider the entire sequence of contextualized embeddings (after self-attention), it's like a 1D image with embedding dimensions acting as channels.  \n",
